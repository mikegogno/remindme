# Notification System PRD - RemindMe Application

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the notification system requirements for RemindMe, focusing on timely, user-friendly alerts that enhance reminder effectiveness without causing notification fatigue.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Notification Types
- **Upcoming Reminders**: Configurable advance notifications (15 min, 1 hour, 1 day)
- **Overdue Reminders**: Alerts for missed deadlines
- **Location-Based**: Proximity-triggered reminders (if implemented)

### 2. User Interface Components

**Notification Center** (`/src/components/notifications/NotificationPage.jsx`):
- List of all notifications with read/unread status
- Mark as read/dismiss actions
- Filter and search capabilities

**Notification Badge**: Unread count indicator in app header

**Notification Preferences** (`/src/components/settings/NotificationPreferences.jsx`):
- Enable/disable notifications
- Timing customization
- Quiet hours configuration

### 3. Technical Requirements

**Data Schema**:
```javascript
{
  id: "string",
  reminderId: "string", 
  userId: "string",
  type: "upcoming|overdue|location",
  message: "string",
  read: boolean,
  createdAt: "ISO string"
}
```

**Key Functions**:
- `getNotifications(userId)` - Retrieve user notifications
- `markAsRead(notificationId)` - Mark notification as read
- `generateNotifications()` - Create notifications for due reminders

### 4. Implementation Priority

**P0 (Must-have)**:
- In-app notification center
- Basic notification generation
- Read/unread management

**P1 (Should-have)**:
- Browser push notifications
- Advanced preferences
- Notification actions

## Success Metrics
- Notification engagement rate > 60%
- User retention improvement through timely alerts
- Minimal notification opt-out rate < 10%

This PRD provides the essential specifications for implementing an effective notification system that enhances user engagement while respecting user preferences.
