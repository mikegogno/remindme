# Dashboard Module PRD - RemindMe Application

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the specifications for the Dashboard Module of the RemindMe application. The Dashboard is a crucial component that provides users with a comprehensive view of their reminders in various formats and allows for efficient reminder management.

### 1.2 Scope
This PRD covers the Dashboard component, Calendar View, and Notifications functionality for the RemindMe application. The features described are designed to work with both Supabase and localStorage backends through the existing storage adapter.

### 1.3 Definitions
- **Reminder**: A task or event with a title, description, date, time, and optional location
- **Filter**: A mechanism to display subsets of reminders based on specific criteria
- **Calendar View**: A visual representation of reminders organized by date
- **Notification**: An alert about upcoming or overdue reminders

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Description

- `markNotificationRead(id)` - Mark a notification as read
- `markAllNotificationsRead(userId)` - Mark all notifications as read
- `deleteNotification(id)` - Delete a notification

### 5.4 Storage Integration
- Must work with both Supabase and localStorage backends
- Use the existing storage adapter for all data operations
- Implement caching strategies for improved performance
- Handle data synchronization when switching backends

## 6. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### 6.1 Performance Requirements
- Dashboard must load within 2 seconds
- Filter switching should be near-instantaneous
- Calendar rendering should be optimized for months with many reminders
- Implement pagination or virtual scrolling for large reminder lists

### 6.2 Accessibility Requirements
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Color coding must include alternative indicators for color-blind users
- Calendar must be navigable with keyboard
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### 6.3 Internationalization
- Support for date formats across different locales
- Support for right-to-left languages in the future
- Time display should respect user's locale settings

### 6.4 Security Considerations
- Ensure reminders are only accessible to their owners
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement proper authentication checks for all data operations

## 7. Future Considerations

### 7.1 Potential Enhancements
- Weekly and daily calendar views
- Drag-and-drop rescheduling in calendar view
- Advanced filtering and searching capabilities
- Reminder sharing between users
- Integration with external calendars (Google, Outlook)
- Push notifications for web and mobile

### 7.2 Known Limitations
- Initial implementation may have limited offline capabilities
- Complex recurring reminder patterns may not be fully supported
- Performance may degrade with extremely large numbers of reminders

## 8. Implementation Timeline

### 8.1 Phase 1: Core Dashboard
- Implement Dashboard component with filter tabs
- Create basic reminder list with completion functionality
- Integrate with storage adapter

### 8.2 Phase 2: Calendar View
- Implement monthly calendar view
- Add reminder indicators on calendar days
- Implement date selection and reminder display

### 8.3 Phase 3: Notifications
- Create notification system
- Implement notification management UI
- Connect to backend storage

## 9. Success Metrics

### 9.1 Qualitative Metrics
- User satisfaction with dashboard layout and usability
- Ease of finding and managing reminders
- Clarity of calendar visualization

### 9.2 Quantitative Metrics
- Time to find a specific reminder
- Number of reminders created per user
- User engagement with different view types
- Percentage of reminders completed on time

## 10. Open Questions

1. Should notifications be implemented as browser notifications, in-app notifications, or both?
2. How should recurring reminders be displayed in the calendar view?
3. Should the calendar view support multiple reminder visualization styles (dots, bars, etc.)?
4. What is the optimal UI treatment for reminders that span multiple days?
5. How should conflicting reminders be displayed in the calendar?

## 11. Conclusion

The Dashboard Module is a critical component of the RemindMe application that enables users to efficiently manage their reminders through multiple visualization options and filtering capabilities. By implementing this module according to the specifications in this PRD, we will deliver a comprehensive and user-friendly experience that forms the core of the RemindMe application's value proposition.
