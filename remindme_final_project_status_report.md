- Implement accessibility best practices throughout the application

## 8. Conclusion
The RemindMe application has made significant progress with several key modules implemented, providing a solid foundation for further development. The authentication system, dashboard interface, and reminder management functionality are well-structured and follow React best practices.

However, substantial work is still required to implement the missing modules and enhance existing functionality. By prioritizing the implementation of LocalStorage fallback, calendar integration, and notification system in the short term, the project can quickly achieve a more functional state.

Following the proposed roadmap will enable systematic completion of all required features while ensuring a coherent user experience. With focused effort on the identified priorities, the RemindMe application can be transformed into a comprehensive productivity tool that meets all specified requirements.
